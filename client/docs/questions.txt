is employment status related to contracts and hence should be dirived from live contracts?

... the questions I sent neil

is sec client group etc to be stored in contracts?

how does currently tie in to contracts ie can I derive from contracts or does it need to be part of client details

what is end date for main details?

how is employment hours in md screen worked out?

I am just bringin across the current job coach associated with md, is there a need for historical?

Do I use versions in md in reports currently and if so do we need in new system?

DO WE NEED CHECK BOX FOR SEC CLIENT GROUP AS IF FILE IS UPLOAED THEN WE HAVE EVIDENCE?

init int, vpplan, poa, do they need versions or can we use created/modified?

in 1->m client to contract, do I need ersions as if I want to know age at paricular date on a contract I can simply work it out?

is md start and end date the project start and end date ie during ths time they may have been on different contracts so it is higher level thatn contracts,
in can we refer to project as grouping of contracts?

does start date and end date get modified via code?
start date  - does this get set programmatically?

reason for closure on md eg: https://backoffice.shirlie.co.uk/client/home/contactsandlifestyle/main_details?cid=5354

logic when project closed and new one startde

Employment Hrs in main details?

md currently I am showing as status - okay? I presume that this spans all contracts - does this get set programmatically?
